r1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.120
Radio interviewer: I’m backstage at the
Birmingham Hippodrome with the comedian Brian Conley.

r1
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.120
Hello Brian.
Nice to see you again.

r2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.330
Brian: Nice to see you too.

r1
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.680
Radio interviewer: Birmingham’s done well
for you over the years, hasn’t it?

r2
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.850
Brain: It certainly has.

r2
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.800
It’s paid my mortgage, definitely.

r2
00:00:14.800 -->  00:00:20.160
I mean, it’s not far from where I live,
it’s just up the motorway, and I love this theatre.

r2
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.110
I’ve got some great memories of here.

r2
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.710
Back in the 90s, especially, when I was doing
panto with Britt Eckland, that was a really 
good time.

r1
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.580
Radio interviewer: You mention panto, which
has, of course an element of audience participation
and rowdiness.

r1
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.030
How do you cope with that?

r1
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.230
Is it something that’s difficult for you?

r2
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.840
Brian: It is difficult, especially with the
kids, you never know what they’re going
to come up with.

r2
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.260
But I’m up for that.

r2
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.560
Some theatres don’t like the kids to come
up on stage any more, they just finish with

r2
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.960
a musical number and that’s it, but I think
that’s a shame, especially now I’ve got
kids of my own.

r2
00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:01.290
What a lot of theatres do now is get the parents
to come down and stand in the aisles, and
if there’s a rowdy kid, we bring the parent
up, and that puts the onus on the parent to
keep the kid in check.

r2
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.700
But I like all that participation.
It’s what gives it energy and makes it live.

r1
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.409
Radio interviewer: You do a range of different
shows though, don’t you?

r2
00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.939
Brian: Yes, I do musical theatre and corporate
work as well as panto, but panto’s the best.

r2
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.340
It plays to my strengths, you know.

r2
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:27.090
I like the fact that it’s got everything,
singing, dancing, comedy, and if there’s
something in the papers that day, I can pick
up on it and put it in the show.

r2
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.289
And that’s something that only I can do,
as the comedy character.

r2
00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.110
The other characters in the show can’t diverge
from the script so much.

r2
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.740
But I can ad lib.

r2
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.889
It’s great.

r2
00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.460
When I work in musical theatre, i can’t
do that.

r2
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.119
I have to stick to the script.

r1
00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.740
Radio Interviewer: So where did it all begin,
this comedy career?

r1
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.369
When was your first time on stage?

r2
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.009
Brian: The first time I was on stage was when
I was two.

r2
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.670
I was at this holiday camp and my mum and
dad lost me in the dance hall.

r2
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.249
Then they heard loads of people laughing and
they saw me up on stage making a fool of myself.

r2
00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:02.649
That was it after that.

r2
00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.049
I was hooked.

r2
00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.040
But what has also driven me is the fact that
I was dyslexic.

r2
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.100
I found it difficult to keep up at school,
because my writing was bad, so I naturally
became the class clown, the school joker.

r2
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.220
But I was always a good singer, and singing
was always my first love.

r2
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.220
Comedy came later.

r2
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.680
When I started doing clubs when I was 17,
I found that you get paid more for doing comedy
than you do for singing.

r1
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.580
Radio Interviewer: And you still do comedy
now.

r2
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280
Brian: Yeah, I do.

r2
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.130
Most of the comedy I do now is actually corporate
work.

r2
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.610
You know, these big work events, where there’s
free food and drink.

r2
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.350
It’s very lucrative, but it’s a tough
crowd.

r2
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.220
They’ve got a load of free alcohol and they
get boozed up.

r2
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.750
There’s a big demand for it these days,
but a lot of famous comedians can’t do it.

r2
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.730
I’ve learnt how to handle it over the years,
and I’ve got an answer for every situation
now.

r2
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.940
I had to fall into it really, it pays the
mortgage.

r1
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.880
Radio Interviewer: And you still get nerves?

r2
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.000
Brian: A guy once said to me that it doesn’t
get any easier.

r2
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.330
I dismissed that.

r2
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.520
I used to reckon that as I got older and more
experienced I’d be more relaxed and I wouldn’t
get so nervous.

r2
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.370
But I realise that he was right.

r2
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.250
I want to do well, and that effects how you
feel before the performance.

r1
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.370
Radio Interviewer: Brain Conley, thank you
very much.
