Conley.

rol1f3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120
Hello Brian.

rol1f4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
Nice to see you again.

rol2f1
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.330
Brian: Nice to see you too.

rol2f2
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.850
Brain: It certainly has.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.800
It’s paid my mortgage, definitely.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.160
I mean, it’s not far from where I live,
it’s just up the motorway, and I love this

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.160
theatre.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.110
I’ve got some great memories of here.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.710
Back in the 90s, especially, when I was doing
panto with Britt Eckland, that was a really

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.710
good time.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.580
Radio interviewer: You mention panto, which
has, of course an element of audience participation

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.580
and rowdiness.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.030
How do you cope with that?

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.230
Is it something that’s difficult for you?

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.840
Brian: It is difficult, especially with the
kids, you never know what they’re going

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840
to come up with.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.260
But I’m up for that.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.560
Some theatres don’t like the kids to come
up on stage any more, they just finish with

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.690
a musical number and that’s it, but I think
that’s a shame, especially now I’ve got

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.960
kids of my own.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.810
What a lot of theatres do now is get the parents
to come down and stand in the aisles, and

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.000
if there’s a rowdy kid, we bring the parent
up, and that puts the onus on the parent to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.290
keep the kid in check.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.850
But I like all that participation.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.700
It’s what gives it energy and makes it live.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.409
Radio interviewer: You do a range of different
shows though, don’t you?

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.939
Brian: Yes, I do musical theatre and corporate
work as well as panto, but panto’s the best.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.340
It plays to my strengths, you know.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.479
I like the fact that it’s got everything,
singing, dancing, comedy, and if there’s

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.090
something in the papers that day, I can pick
up on it and put it in the show.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.289
And that’s something that only I can do,
as the comedy character.

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.110
The other characters in the show can’t diverge
from the script so much.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.740
But I can ad lib.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.889
It’s great.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.460
When I work in musical theatre, i can’t
do that.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.119
I have to stick to the script.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.740
Radio Interviewer: So where did it all begin,
this comedy career?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.369
When was your first time on stage?

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.009
Brian: The first time I was on stage was when
I was two.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.670
I was at this holiday camp and my mum and
dad lost me in the dance hall.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.249
Then they heard loads of people laughing and
they saw me up on stage making a fool of myself.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:02.649
That was it after that.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.049
I was hooked.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.040
But what has also driven me is the fact that
I was dyslexic.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.031
I found it difficult to keep up at school,
because my writing was bad, so I naturally

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.100
became the class clown, the school joker.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.220
But I was always a good singer, and singing
was always my first love.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.220
Comedy came later.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.440
When I started doing clubs when I was 17,
I found that you get paid more for doing comedy

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.680
than you do for singing.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.580
Radio Interviewer: And you still do comedy
now.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280
Brian: Yeah, I do.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.130
Most of the comedy I do now is actually corporate
work.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.610
You know, these big work events, where there’s
free food and drink.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.350
It’s very lucrative, but it’s a tough
crowd.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.220
They’ve got a load of free alcohol and they
get boozed up.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.750
There’s a big demand for it these days,
but a lot of famous comedians can’t do it.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.730
I’ve learnt how to handle it over the years,
and I’ve got an answer for every situation

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.730
now.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.940
I had to fall into it really, it pays the
mortgage.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.880
Radio Interviewer: And you still get nerves?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.000
Brian: A guy once said to me that it doesn’t
get any easier.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.330
I dismissed that.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.580
I used to reckon that as I got older and more
experienced I’d be more relaxed and I wouldn’t

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.520
get so nervous.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.370
But I realise that he was right.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.250
I want to do well, and that effects how you
feel before the performance.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.370
Radio Interviewer: Brain Conley, thank you
very much.
